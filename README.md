mysql -u USERNAME -p war < schema.sql
mysql -u USERNAME -p war < data.sql

2. Java Application

Open your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).

Import the project as a Maven/Gradle project (if applicable).

Ensure the JDBC driver is on the classpath (mysql-connector-java).

Update DatabaseHelper.java with your DB credentials.

Run the main class (e.g., BarChartExample) to launch the application.

3. Python Visualization (Optional)

If you want advanced data analysis and interactive plots:

Install Python (>=3.8) and pip.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
